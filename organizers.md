				</header>
				<p> Amanjot Kaur ("Jot") is a Master's student in Horticulture and Agronomy working on an interdisciplinary project between Plant Breeding and Genetics under Dr. Dina St. Clair and Biological and Agricultural Engineering under Dr. Irwin Donis-Gonzalez. Her graduate work focuses on high-throughput phenotyping of physiochemical traits in vegetables using spectroscopy-based engineering technologies. In addition to her thesis research, she is also working as a crop lead with the SCOPE (Student Collaborative Organic Plant Breeding and Education) project to breed heirloom-type tomato varieties for organic farming systems for fruit quality traits and plant architecture parameters. She received her B.S. degree in Biotechnology with an emphasis in plants from UC Davis in 2016. Amanjot’s hobbies include meditating and eating food!

				</header>
                <p>Saarah Kuzay is a PhD student under Prof. Jorge Dubcovsky in the Horticulture and Agronomy Graduate Group. Her thesis work is focused on understanding the genetic basis of the number of spikelets per spike (SPS) in wheat, a yield component trait for pasta and bread wheat. She is using positional cloning to dissect the quantitative trait loci for number of spikelets per spike (SPS) located on chromosome arm 7AL (160-165 Mb). Ultimately, Saarah hopes to isolate this gene for SPS and deploy it in the UC Davis and CYMMIT wheat breeding programs. Outside of her thesis research, she is also working with SCOPE (Student Collaborative Organic Plant-Breeding and Education) to breed jalapeño and bell peppers for organic farming systems under Allen Van Deynze and Charles Brummer.

				</header>
				<p>Mitchell Feldmann is a 3rd year doctoral student of horticulture and agronomy in the Strawberry Breeding and Research program at UC Davis. He completed his BS in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with a minor in mathematics at the University of Arizona under Dr. Noah Whiteman, where he discovered a passion for biological research. Mitchell's scientific interests include quantitative and evolutionary genetics relating to plant breeding and crop improvement. His current work includes the evaluation of heterosis, theoretical evaluations of QTL heritability estimates, and genomic selection application in the cultivated strawberry.

				</header>
				<p>Laila Fayyaz is a Ph.D. candidate in the Graduate Group of Horticulture and Agronomy. She works in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at the University of California, Davis. She is working with Dr. Andrew Walker in his grapevine breeding research program. She completed her master's and bachelor's degrees in Plant Breeding and Genetics at the University of Agriculture Peshawar-Pakistan. Although she is currently working with grapevines, she has extensive experience with other crops as well. Her undergraduate research focused on phenotyping wild accessions of rice. For her master's project, she worked on oliferous species of Brassica. She has now moved on to grapes, one of the most popular fruit crops in the world. Her current project focuses on map-based cloning of genes for powdery mildew resistance from the Chinese grape species <i>Viti piasezkii</i>. Her goal is to understand the genetic relationship between the host plant, grapevines and the pathogen, <i>E. necator</i> and ultimately understand the mechanism of grapevine defense against the powdery mildew disease caused by <i>E. necator</i>.
