                <p>Christopher Topp is an Assistant Investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center (since 2013), a non-profit plant science research institute. For the past fifteen years, Dr. Topp has studied fundamental processes, both small and large, that drive the growth and productivity of crop plants. Originally trained as a centromere biologist at the University of Georgia (PhD; 2003-2009), he studied the biochemistry and evolution of cell division machinery in maize and oats. As a USDA-NIFA postdoctoral scholar (2011-2013) at Duke University (2009-2013), he led a team of engineers, computer scientists, and biologists in the development of a 3D root imaging and analysis pipeline, which was used to map regions of the rice genome controlling root growth. His current research focuses on subterranean phenotyping in multiple crop species, as well as identifying the environmental and genetic factors that condition their growth. By integrating these efforts with natural variation and modern genomics, he aims to contribute to the development of new crop varieties with root systems capable of drought tolerance and efficient nutrient uptake. His team at the Danforth Center continues to develop technologies and infrastructure that enable the analysis of the ‘hidden half’ of plants.

                    <p>Dr Sean Myles is an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Agriculture at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada.  He obtained an MSc in Human Biology from Oxford University and a PhD in Genetics from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.  He switched his focus to plants when he joined Ed Buckler's lab at Cornell University to complete a postdoc in grape genomics.  He also completed a postdoc at Stanford in Carlos Bustamante's lab before beginning as a faculty member at Dalhousie University in 2011.  He has published genomics studies focussed on humans, apples, grape and cannabis.  He primarily focusses now on apples.  To this end, he established the Apple Biodiversity Collection in Nova Scotia - an orchard with over 1000 varieties of apples planted in duplicate. The aim of his work is to establish genotype-phenotype associations that can be leveraged by apple breeders to develop novel varieties that taste great and require less chemical input to grow.

                    <p>Sarah Hearne is a Principal Scientist at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), headquartered in Mexico. Her work focuses on the interface between genetic resources and plant breeding and in the adaptation/development and use of tools to enhance the identification and transfer of useful native genetic variation from exotic germplasm to breeding germplasm. She leads the maize and informatics work of the Seeds of Discovery (SeeD) initiative at CIMMYT. The work conducted under this initiative extends from; genotypic characterization and assessment of molecular diversity of the entire maize collection housed in the International CIMMYT germplasm bank, GWAS for high priority traits across the world’s most diverse maize panel, genomic selection for high value traits across maize landraces, selection sweep evaluation for key adaptive and anthropogenic characteristics, optimization of selection techniques and breeding approaches for GS application in the landrace context, development of semi-inbred bridging breeding germplasm for dissemination to breeders worldwide, development of informatics tools to better facilitate data capture, curation, interpretation and dissemination within genetic resource and breeding research applications.

                    </header>
                    <p style="color:#c99700;">Dr. Zakharov's research focuses on understanding plant volatile metabolism in the context of 1) aroma development in fruits and vegetables, and 2) plant defense mechanisms against pests. Although much progress has been made in achieving and maintaining good appearance quality of fruits and vegetables, there is a general consensus that flavor quality is "the last frontier". Flavor, defined as the combined sensation derived from taste and aroma, is a complex trait that is still poorly understood at analytical, biochemical and molecular levels. The Zakharov lab investigates how volatile compounds (which confer the aroma of fruits and vegetables) are formed during fruit development and ripening, and how postharvest storage conditions affect their production.

His work on <i>Arabidopsis</i>, a model plant, is helping to understand the role of abiotic stress in enhancing epigenomic plasticity that can be used in breeding for agronomically important traits. Sunil received the distinguished Henry M. Beachell Fellowship in 2016 recognizing his academic excellence and research potential in the agronomic and horticultural sciences.
