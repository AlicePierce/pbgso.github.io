    Jorge Dubcovsky received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Biological Sciences from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. He began his career at U.C. Davis as a visiting scientist with Dr. Jan Dvorak in 1992 and later joined the professorial ranks in the Department of Plant Sciences. Dr. Dubcovsky now leads the U.C. Davis Wheat Breeding Program and Wheat Molecular Genetics Laboratory. For the last 12 years he has been the project director of successful Nation-wide projects to implement marker assisted selection in public wheat breeding programs. He is a member of the National Academy of Science, fellow of the CSSA and ASA and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Researcher. He is author of more than 173 publications that had a significant impact on wheat genetics (~8400 cross-references). He has generated 8 PVP patents for wheat varieties and 4 patents for discovered genes. He also has served as major professor for 7 M.S. and 12 Ph.D. students. The major goal of Dr. Dubcovsky&#8217;s research program are to gain a better understanding of the effects of allelic variants of wheat genes that are relevant to agriculture and to develop the tools required for an efficient manipulation of these genes in wheat improvement.

    The general focus of his research program is innovation of vegetables for adaptation for production in the Northeastern US of improved quality and nutrition for consumers. Much of his selection is done in Organic systems that represent a more natural environment, which allows for the creation of new varieties that better contain otherwise cryptic factors that allow for crop production with fewer synthetic inputs, as well as identify testable hypotheses regarding the genetic nature of these factors. These studies take place with pepper, squash, cucumber, melon, watermelon, and snap peas using genomics, genetics, molecular biology, field trials or analytical chemistry. The resulting germplasm and knowledge is shared with global partners that are dealing with the same issues in their diverse regions.

    <strong>Peggy G. Lemaux, Cooperative Extension Specialist in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, University of California, Berkeley</strong>
  </div>
  
  <p>
    Although not formally trained in plant biology, Peggy Lemaux was drawn to research aimed at improving agriculture because of her experiences growing up on a small farm in northwestern Ohio. She got her Bachelor’s degree at Miami University in Oxford OH and her Ph.D. at the University of Michigan. After postdoctoral positions at Stanford and the Carnegie Institute of Washington, Department of Plant Biology, also at Stanford, she worked at DeKalb Plant Genetics where their group was the first to successfully engineer maize. She joined the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology at UC Berkeley in 1991 as a Cooperative Extension Specialist, the responsibilities of which are two-fold. The first is to conduct applied research, which for the most part has focused on engineering cereal crops. In her second role, she develops educational programming to increase public understanding of agricultural practices, food production and the impact of new technologies on food and agriculture. Lemaux’s research centers on the use of engineering and genomic technologies to understand and improve cereals, like wheat, barley and sorghum. Applied projects include development of faster germinating barley with improved starch characteristics for the brewing industry, a hypoallergenic wheat variety for consumers with wheat allergies, preharvest sprouting-tolerant wheat to ameliorate impacts of climate change and the nutritional enhancement of sorghum for Africa. Most recently she became involved in a DOE project to make drop-in fuels in tobacco leaves by engineering them with algal genes. Lemaux is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, American Society of Agronomy and the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB) and is currently their immediate past president. She received ASPB’s Hoagland award for outstanding contributions to agriculture and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Society of In Vitro Biology.

He was a founding member of the Keystone Roundtable on Sustainable Agriculture, co-chair of the 1st and 2nd World Congress of Agroforestry and is Chairperson of the External Advisory Board of the Agriculture Sustainability Institute at UC Davis. In 2009 Howard was named recipient of The Award of Distinction from The College of Agriculture and Environmental Sciences, UC Davis. He led the global effort to sequence, assemble and annotate the <i>Theobroma </i>cacao genome and is part of the leadership team for the <i>Arachis</i> genome global effort. In 2010 he was named a Senior Fellow in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of California, Davis. In September 2011, he announced the formation of the African Orphan Crops Consortium, set up to sequence, assemble and annotate 100 of the key African food crops in order to breed more nutritious plants as well as to train senior scientists and technicians on the methods of marker assisted selection and breeding to speed new cultivars to the African rural population. In December, 2013 the first class of breeders enrolled in the academy at in Nairobi, Kenya, a collaborative effort of the Orphan Crops Initiative, the World Agroforestry Centre the New Partnership for Africa’s Development and the UC Davis Seed Biotechnology Center.
