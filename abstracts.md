<b style="color:#002285;">This year's symposium will provide <b>graduate students and post-docs in plant science related fields</b> an opportunity to showcase their work in form of <b>posters</b> (see <a href="/program.html">program</a>). Additionally, four presenters will be competitively chosen to present their work in the form of 20 minute <b>oral presentations</b> (see <a href="/program.html">program</a>). 
<br><br>
We will be offering <b>four $500 travel grants</b>. All submitted abstracts will be considered for these travel grants and winners will be competitively chosen. Note: the application deadline to be considered for a travel grant is <b>March 10</b>. Applications received past this deadline (until <b>March 31</b>) will be considered for presentations but not for a travel grant.
