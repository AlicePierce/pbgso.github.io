				Maria Jos&eacute; Aranzana is a researcher at the Research Institute of Agriculture, Food Research and Technology (IRTA) in Spain. After graduating in agronomy, she conducted a doctoral training in peach genetics and genomics at IRTA, and postdoctoral trainings at the University of Southern California (USA) and at the Centre of Research for Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) in Spain. Her area of research is in the field of Rosaceae genetics and genomics, including peach, Japanese plum, apple and pear. Her team is interested in different aspects of Rosaceae genome organization, variability and evolution that help to elucidate the genetics of important agricultural traits. Their aim is to apply this information to develop tools, as high quality markers for markers assisted selection (MAS) and genetic materials (including collections of introgression lines), to improve plant breeding efficiency.

                <p> Malia Gehan did undergraduate research on heat stress and thermotolerance in tobacco at Willamette University and she did her Ph.D. research examining the intersection of cold signaling and the circadian at Michigan State University. She was a NSF Plant Genome Postdoctoral Fellow and is currently an Assistant Member and Principal Investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, whose group focuses understanding mechanisms of crop resilience under temperature stress. To study temperature stress and natural variation, the Gehan lab develops high-throughput and high-resolution image-based phenotyping technologies, including low-cost solutions that use Raspberry Pi computers. The Gehan Lab co-develops and maintain the open-source open-development suite of image analysis tools, PlantCV (https://plantcv.danforthcenter.org/), along with Dr. Noah Fahlgren’s group. Dr. Gehan was part of the steering committee that helped to form the North American Plant Phenotyping Network and was elected to the board in 2020. Dr. Gehan is interested in increasing communication and connections across phenomics-related disciplines and organizations; using plant phenotyping as away of increasing student interest in plant science and skills in data science; and democratizing plant phenotyping using open-source hardware and software.

					Grey is an evolutionary plant geneticist and Assistant Professor in the Department of Plant Sciences at UC Davis. He completed a Ph.D. of Ecology in 2019 at Colorado State University studying climate adaptation in both wild and domesticated plant species. He was then a post-doc at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology where he investigated functional genome evolution and how mutation bias gives rise to beneficial genetic variation in plants. In 2020, he started The Genomics of Climate Adaptation lab at UC Davis. He loves being able to work with creative scientists everyday to develop a deeper understanding of evolutionary processes and address practical challenges confronting agriculture in the context of climate adaptation.
