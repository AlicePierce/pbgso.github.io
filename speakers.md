<p style="color:#202520; margin-left:150px; margin-right: 150px">Dr. Pamela Ronald is recognized for research in infectious disease biology and environmental stress tolerance. Her isolation of the rice Xa21 immune receptor in 1995 and of a novel microbial immunogen in 2015 revealed a new mechanism with which plants and animals detect and respond to infection. She is also known for her leading role in isolation of the rice Submergence Tolerance 1 gene. Her research facilitated the development of high yielding Sub1 rice varieties grown by more than six million subsistence farmers in India and Bangladesh.<a href =  "https://cropgeneticsinnovation.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style = "text-decoration: none">[Read more]</a></p>
