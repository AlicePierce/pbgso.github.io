					<h3>Robin Hopkins</h3>
                    <a href="http://hopkins-lab.org" class="icon fa-home"></a>
				</header>
				<p>Dr. Robin Hopkins is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. She received her PhD from Duke University where she studied the genetics, ecology, and evolution of speciation in plants.  Prior to starting her lab at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, she was awarded a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology to use mathematical models to investigate the role of natural selection in speciation. Her research characterizes and quantifies the forces of selection, gene flow, and mutation during the process of speciation. She integrates genetic, genomic, and field bases research to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of hybridization, and how closely related plant lineages have evolved barriers to prevent reproducing.

					<h3>José Dinneny</h3>
                    <a href="https://dinnenylab.me/" class="icon fa-home"></a>
				</header>
				<p>José Dinneny received his BS from UC Berkeley in Plant Biology and Genetics in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and PhD from UC San Diego working with Detlef Weigel at the Salk Institute for Biological Science and Martin Yanofsky in the Division of Biology, UCSD. His work focused on the cloning and characterization of JAGGED and NUBBIN in flower and fruit development. He then went to Duke University to do his post-doctoral studies with Philip Benfey. There he utilized Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to develop the first tissue-specific map of transcriptional changes occurring during abiotic stress. José established his independent lab at the Temasek Lifesciences Laboratory (TLL) in Singapore with a joint appointment at the National University of Singapore, Department of Biological Sciences. He was an inaugural fellow of the National Research Foundation, Singapore. José moved his lab in 2011 to the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology. In 2018 José joined the faculty at Stanford University in the Biology Department as an Associate Professor.

                    <p>Dr. Stacey Harmer is a Professor in the Department of Plant Biology at UC Davis.  She earned a PhD in Biochemistry at UC San Francisco and then moved to a postdoctoral scholar position at the Scripps Research Institute.  Her lab studies plant adaptations to the abiotic environment.  Specifically, her research focuses on the plant circadian clock, addressing both the molecular nature of the oscillator that generates daily rhythms and aspects of plant physiology affected by the circadian system.  She is particularly interested in exploring relationships between clock, light, and growth signaling pathways. Her recognitions have included a Howard Hughes Predoctoral Fellowship, an NIH National Research Service Award, an American Society for Photobiology New Investigator Award, and the UC Davis Chancellor's Fellowship.

                <p>Dr. Maeli Melotto is an assistant professor in the Department of Plant Sciences at UC Davis. Dr. Melotto completed her Ph.D. in plant breeding and genetics at Michigan State University before joining the UC Davis faculty in 2014. Her research is focused on understanding the close interaction between plants and pathogens at the molecular level. Her work aims to determine the physiological changes that happen in both the plant and the pathogen when they come into contact. Specifically to understand how the plant immune system works to fight against pathogen infection and how pathogens employ virulence strategies to overcome plant defenses. This line of research is critical for the development of environmentally sound methods to minimize the impact of diseases and economic losses in agriculture worldwide, and to reduce food contamination with human pathogens in crops such as leafy vegetables.
