				Maria Jos&eacute; Aranzana is a researcher at the Research Institute of Agriculture, Food Research and Technology (IRTA) in Spain. After graduating in agronomy, she conducted a doctoral training in peach genetics and genomics at IRTA, and postdoctoral trainings at the University of Southern California (USA) and at the Centre of Research for Agricultural Genomics (CRAG) in Spain. Her area of research is in the field of Rosaceae genetics and genomics, including peach, Japanese plum, apple and pear. Her team is interested in different aspects of Rosaceae genome organization, variability and evolution that help to elucidate the genetics of important agricultural traits. Their aim is to apply this information to develop tools, as high quality markers for markers assisted selection (MAS) and genetic materials (including collections of introgression lines), to improve plant breeding efficiency.

				<p>David Habier is a quantitative geneticist who leads the Methodology and Software Innovations team at Corteva Agriscience. His team researches and develops methods, algorithms and software tools for spatial field analyses, genetic evaluation, genomic prediction, QTL mapping, and evaluation of transgenes in multiple genetic backgrounds. These tools are used across crops of Corteva’s seed product development pipelines. David studied agricultural sciences at the Technical University of Munich, where he received a doctoral degree in animal breeding for his work on optimization of a pig breeding program. He then joined professors Rohan Fernando, Jack Dekkers, and Dorian Garrick as a postdoctoral fellow at Iowa State University, and contributed outstanding research in the field of genomic prediction. Before joining the company, he taught quantitative genetics and animal breeding at the University of Kiel in Germany and helped both German Holstein and poultry breeders understand genomic prediction.

			Dr. Kaitlin (Katie) Gold is an Assistant Professor of Grape Pathology at Cornell University where she holds the primary research and extension responsibilities for grape disease management for New York state. Katie’s research combines plant pathology, machine learning, and remote sensing to study the fundamental and applied science of plant disease sensing to improve early disease detection and sustainable integrated management. Katie leads the Grape Sensing, Pathology, and Extension laboratory at Cornell AgriTech (GrapeSPEC). Katie completed her PhD in Plant Pathology and MS in Applied Statistics concurrently at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 2019, where her dissertation research pioneered the use of hyperspectral imaging for pre-symptomatic disease and diagnosis. Prior to starting her tenure-track position at Cornell, she held a visiting faculty fellowship at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA with the Carbon and Ecosystem Cycling and Imaging Spectroscopy Groups to use AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral imagery for asymptomatic grape disease detection and mapping.

					Brian Bailey started as an assistant professor in the UC Davis Plant Sciences Department in 2016. His research combines engineering, computer science, atmospheric science, and biology to study plant systems. In particular, Brian's lab is developing high-resolution, 3D models and measurement techniques that can explicitly represent plant-environment interactions at scales ranging from leaves to canopies. Recent work in the Bailey lab has focused on developing models for woody perennial crops such as almond and grapevine. Brian received his MS and PhD degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Utah.
