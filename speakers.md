					<h3>CJ Schwartz</h3>
                    <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cj_Schwartz2" class="icon fa-home"></a>
				</header>
				<p> 
				CJ Schwartz received his BS degree in Genetics from the University of Minnesota, a Ph.D. in Biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin, and a postdoc at the Salk Institute in San Diego with Joanne Chory and Detlef Weigel focusing on natural variation of light responsiveness. After nearly 20 years in academia, CJ founded a company 5 years ago (Sunrise Genetics), which applies modern molecular genetic techniques for gene discovery and marker assisted selection (MAS) breeding in Cannabis. In collaboration with the University of Minnesota and the J. Craig Venter Institute, Sunrise Genetics was the first to make public a high-quality Cannabis genome assembly, which is recognized as the Cannabis genomic reference accession by NCBI.

				<p> 
					Brian Bailey started as an assistant professor in the UC Davis Plant Sciences Department in 2016. His research combines engineering, computer science, atmospheric science, and biology to study plant systems. In particular, Brian's lab is developing high-resolution, 3D models and measurement techniques that can explicitly represent plant-environment interactions at scales ranging from leaves to canopies. Recent work in the Bailey lab has focused on developing models for woody perennial crops such as almond and grapevine. Brian received his MS and PhD degrees in mechanical engineering from the University of Utah.

				</header>
				<p> 
				Dr. Elisabeth Forrestel started as an Assistant Professor at UC Davis in Viticulture and Enology in fall 2019. She received her bachelor's degree in biology from Cornell University and her PhD in Ecology & Evolutionary biology from Yale University. Dr. Forrestel went on to complete postdoctoral work at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University studying the phenological responses of winegrapes to a warming climate. As an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow, she came to UC Davis to study the phylogenetic and functional basis of abiotic stress responses in wild and cultivated grapevine. Her research program at Davis addresses questions about the evolutionary and ecophysiological basis of drought and heat responses in grapevine, and how irrigation practices mitigate stress responses. Dr. Forrestel will apply her research to improve understanding of how we can utilize wild species and cultivar diversity to adapt to warmer and drier climates, and inform viable management practices in vineyards in response to heat stress.

		Troy is an Assistant Professor this year in the Department of Plant Sciences. He was most recently a research scientist in the Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems group at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, CA. His research tries to ‘see’ the things that feed our families, clean our air, and nourish our ecosystems a little differently. His lab group distills images of fields and forests into a kaleidoscope of colors to inform our understanding of plant health, productivity, and stress.
