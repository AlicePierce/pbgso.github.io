					<h3>Robin Hopkins</h3>
                    <a href="http://hopkins-lab.org" class="icon fa-home"></a>
				</header>
				<p>Dr. Robin Hopkins is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University. She received her PhD from Duke University where she studied the genetics, ecology, and evolution of speciation in plants.  Prior to starting her lab at the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, she was awarded a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology to use mathematical models to investigate the role of natural selection in speciation. Her research characterizes and quantifies the forces of selection, gene flow, and mutation during the process of speciation. She integrates genetic, genomic, and field based research to understand the ecological and evolutionary consequences of hybridization, and how closely related plant lineages have evolved barriers to prevent reproducing.

				</header>
				<p> José Dinneny received his BS from UC Berkeley in Plant Biology and Genetics in the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology and PhD from UC San Diego working with Detlef Weigel at the Salk Institute for Biological Science and Martin Yanofsky in the Division of Biology, UCSD. His work focused on the cloning and characterization of JAGGED and NUBBIN in flower and fruit development. He then went to Duke University to do his post-doctoral studies with Philip Benfey. There he utilized Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) to develop the first tissue-specific map of transcriptional changes occurring during abiotic stress. José established his independent lab at the Temasek Lifesciences Laboratory (TLL) in Singapore. He moved his lab in 2011 to the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of Plant Biology. In 2018 José joined the faculty at Stanford University in the Biology Department as an Associate Professor.

                    <p> Seung Yon (Sue) Rhee is a Senior Staff Member of Plant Biology Department at Carnegie Institution for Science. Her group strives to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive traits in the face of heat, drought, nutrient limitation, latitude and pests. Dr. Rhee’s group studies a variety of plants including models, orphan crops, medicinal and desert plants. More recently their work has involved studying a model nematode C. elegans, fungal pathogens, corals, and piezophilic bacterium. Her group employs computational modeling and targeted laboratory testing to study mechanisms of adaptation, functions of novel genes, organization and function of metabolic networks, and chemical and neuronal code of plant-animal interactions. Her group is also interested in developing translational research programs involving carbon sequestration by plants and biomass maximization under drought in bioenergy crops. Dr. Rhee received her B.A. in biology from Swarthmore College and a Ph.D. in biology from Stanford University. She has been an investigator at the Plant Biology Department of Carnegie Institution for Science since 1999.

				</header>
				<p> My lab uses experimental and modeling approaches to better understand the eco-evolutionary processes underpinning the spread and escalation of weedy and invasive plants both in agricultural and natural systems. Our research has direct outcomes for ecological management of weeds and thus can help reduce the use of chemicals in weed management.

                <p>Amélie Gaudin joined the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of California Davis in 2015 as an assistant professor of Agroecology. She obtained a Ph.D. in Plant Agriculture at the University of Guelph and worked as an agronomist and crop physiologist at various CGIAR centers to sustainably intensify staple food crop production in smallholder farming systems. Her current research focus on developing and testing sustainable management practices that have conservation of natural resources, agrobiodiversity and ecosystem services as a basis for improvements. She investigates how cropping system management affects the crop and soil mechanisms involved in maintaining or recovering ecosystem services along stress and fertility gradients. She is interested in better understanding root system and rhizosphere ecology and their potential to harness improvements in soil health, sequester carbon and decrease crop water and nutrients requirements.
