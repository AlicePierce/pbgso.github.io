<p style="color:#202520; margin-left:150px; margin-right: 150px">Dr. Sinha is a professor in the department of Plant Biology at UC Davis whose research is in plant evolutionary developmental biology. Her early work examined the genes controlling leaf development, and she demonstrated that the KNOTTED-1 homeobox (knox1) gene regulates leaf formation in maize. Building on that work, she showed that knox genes are involved in determining leaf shape, and she uncovered additional genes involved in leaf development. She has also carried out research on the molecular genetics of plant parasites. She was elected to be a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2005 and the American Society of Plant Biologists in 2018. <a href =  "http://sinhalab.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style = "text-decoration: none">[Read more]</a></p>
