We will do a <strong style="color:#202520">symptom survey check</strong> at the event. If your symptom survey returns “Yellow” (overdue testing) or "Red" you will not be able to attend! We recommend getting COVID tested through UC Davis or Healthy Davis Together on Wednesday or Thursday, May 25th or May 26th.

Community transmission of COVID remains high in Yolo county (as of May 16, 2022). We are encouraging all participants regardless of vaccination status to please remain masked at all times indoors to reduce transmission. The Alumni Center has an outdoor courtyard which we will be using for aspects of the event.  <strong style="color:#202520">Please be courteous, and make this event as safe as possible for all of us.</strong>
