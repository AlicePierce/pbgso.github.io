This year's symposium will provide <b>graduate students and post-docs in plant science related fields</b> an opportunity to showcase their work in form of <b>posters</b> (see <a href="/#program">program</a>). Additionally, two graduate students will be competitively chosen to present their work in the form of 20 minute <b>oral presentations</b> (see <a href="/#program">program</a>); <b>post-docs are ineligible for oral presentations</b>. 
<br><br>
To celebrate the 5th year of the student-organized UC Davis Plant Breeding Symposium, we will be offering <b>five $500 travel grants</b> to current students. All submitted abstracts will be considered for these travel grants and winners will be competitively chosen. Note: the application deadline to be considered for a travel grant is <b>February 29</b>. Applications received past this deadline (until <b>March 15</b>) will be considered for presentations but not for a travel grant. 
<br><br>

The application form is now <b>closed</b>. We are unable to accept abstracts for oral presentations. However, we may still be able to accomodate additional posters. For additional details, please write to Gitanshu Munjal (gmunjal (at) ucdavis (dot) edu) indicating “UCDPBS16” in the Subject.
