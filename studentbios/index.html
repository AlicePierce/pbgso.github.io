# Student Biographies

## Cintia Helena Duarte Sagawa
<img style="float: left;" src="../img/jetpacktocat.png">
Cintia Helena Duarte Sagawa is a second year PhD student in the Plant Biology Graduate Group and a Graduate Student Researcher in Professor Abhaya Dandekar’s Lab in the Department of Plant Sciences at the University of California, Davis. She is a biologist interested in understanding genotype-phenotype interactions in plants as well as immune and virulence factors of plant pathogens. She graduated from Sao Paulo State University (UNESP) in Brazil, where she also received her master’s degree in Genetics with a focus on genetic and QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci) mapping. She worked as a junior specialist in the Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC) for two years where she was involved in several projects in the citrus breeding program.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Hi! I am a 2nd year Ph.D. Student in Horticulture and Agronomy at Dr. Andrew Walker´s Lab. I am part of the Pierce´s Disease (PD) resistant wine grape breeding program. I come from Ciudad Juárez, México, where I got my B.S. in Chemistry. Apart from plant breeding, evolution and plant genetics, my interests lay in science communication and education.

I study comparative and functional genomics of downy mildew pathgoens in the Michelmore lab at UC Davis. Our lab has recently sequenced the genomes of several downy mildews, including those infecting lettuce, spinach, tobacco, and chard and my research is focused on using bioinformatics to predict candidate effector genes and testing those candidates the lab to identify functional pathogenicity proteins. In addition to contributing to our understanding of the mechanisms of pathogenesis, the study of effectors will be useful for breeding disease resistance in lettuce. My experience in the biotech industry has taught me that scientific progress can be achieved by bridging the gap between basic and applied science. I believe that collaborations between industry and academia are vital to increase crop productivity and work towards improving plant stress resilience in the face of a changing global climate.

I am a second-year PhD student in UC Davis Horticulture & Agronomy Graduate Group. I am interested in crop genetics and breeding. After finishing my undergraduate study as an agronomy major student in China Agricultural University, I came to UC Davis as a PhD student. Currently, I am working with Dr. Jan Dvorak on wheat evolutional genetics.

<p align="left">
Susan Moenga a Ph.D. student in the Plant Biology Graduate Group, is a member of Doug Cook’s Chickpea Innovation lab at UC Davis. Her focus is drought stress tolerance related traits and genes in wild chickpea populations that can be useful in breeding for climate resilience. 
Before UC Davis, she received her master’s degree in Plant Biotechnology from Wageningen University, in the Netherlands. While in Wageningen, Susan was affiliated with Ton Bisselling’s group, where she investigated the genetic underpinning of nitrogen fixation traits in Parasponia. She received her bachelor’s degree from Kenyatta University, Kenya and has previously worked with Monsanto, with the Water Efficient Maize for Africa (WEMA) project, developing drought tolerant maize varieties.
