# Speaker Biographies

## Jill Farrant
<img style="float: right; padding-left:1%;" src="../img/speakers/jill-farrant-frame.png">
<p align ="left">
Jill Farrant is a full Professor and holds a South African Research Chair in “Systems Biology Studies on Plant Desiccation Tolerance for Food Security” in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Cape Town.  She is an acknowledged world leader in the field of plant desiccation tolerance (holding a rarely given A rated status by the South African National Research Foundation), working on both seeds and resurrection plants. Her fundamental research involves use of a systems biology approach (using techniques in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology and physiology) to understand the protection mechanisms (and regulation thereof) laid down in orthodox seeds and vegetative tissue of resurrection plants, with the ultimate aim of using key protectants identified to make drought tolerant crops.  She has received considerable recognition for her research,  having achieved 10 national and international awards, the most recent being the L’Oreal-UNESCO award in life sciences (2012) that ‘recognizes women whose exceptional careers in science have opened up new and sometimes revolutionary ways of improving human well-being’ and the  EPFL WISH Foundation Erma Hamburger award for ‘ground breaking work in phytology and being a exceptional role model to plant biologists world wide’. Jill has graduated 32 MSc organizers and 19 PhD organizers during the 22 years she has been an academic.

<p align ="left">
Dr. Luis Herrera Estrella, a pioneer and leading expert on genetic engineering, received a Ph.D. in plant molecular biology from the State University of Ghent, Belgium, where he also conducted postgraduate research.
<br><br>
His current research is focused on the study of the molecular mechanisms that regulate the development of plant roots in response to environmental factors and in the field of functional genomics of several endemic species of Mexico.
<br><br>
He is a Howard Hughes Distinguished Fellow, and a member of US National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Herrera has received the Distinguished Graduate Research Award by the New York Academy of Sciences, Javed Husain award by UNESCO, Gold Medal by WIPO (World Intellectual Property Organization), etc. 
<br><br>
Dr.Herrera Estrella has graduated many students under his direction, such as: 17 BSc, 13 MSc, and 34 PhD. His research has generated 5 patents and more than 200 publications in international journals and books which have received more than 8,500 citations. 
<br><br>
He recently created the company called StelaGenomics, which is dedicated to the development of genetically modified crops designed to reduce the use of fertilizers and agrochemicals in agriculture. 
<br><br>
In 2015 Dr. Herrera Estrella was elected Honorary Professor by Nanjing Agricultural University and the Magazine of Science “Scientific American” elected him as one of the 100 most influential people in biotechnology. Currently, he is the Director and Full Professor of the National Laboratory of Genomics for Biodiversity.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
