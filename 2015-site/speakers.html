  <p style="text-align: center;">
     Director of the Generation Challenge Program (GCP), a 10-year initiative of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), is responsible for leading and coordinating a large network of partners in modern crop breeding for food security. Jean-Marcel has cumulative experience in agriculture biotechnology and plant breeding, project and finance management and policy formulation, as well as leadership skills for dispersed global R&amp;D teams. Since December 2014 Jean-Marcel is the Director of the Integrated Breeding Platform:<a href="https:/www.integratedbreeding.net"> https:/www.integratedbreeding.net</a>
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    Jean-Marcel holds a PhD in Plant Physiology from Lausanne University, Switzerland. His scientific background is in plant physiology and genetics, with main research interest being understanding the genetic basis and underlying physiological and metabolic pathways that influence plant performance under abiotic stress– particularly drought – as well as innovations in molecular breeding.
  </p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center;">
    Jean-Marcel has a particular interest in promoting modern breeding methods to hasten crop improvement in the developing world, helping to weave effective and interactive communities of crop researchers at both the global and regional levels, bridging the gap between basic and applied agricultural science. He believes in true partnership and solid capacity building to overcome some of the bottlenecks in R4D, with the developing-country partners as key actors and leaders in the research arena.

    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Isabelle Goldringer is a research director at INRA (National Institute of Agronomic Research) in France where she is group leader of the Diversity, Evolution, and Adaptation of Populations team. Using a “middle-term” (25 generations) evolution experiment in wheat, she has developed research in evolutionary genetics applied to subdivided self-pollinating populations with particular focus on the middle-term effects of selection on genetic diversity, and on the adaptive mechanisms involved in response to local selection.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      She is also involved in more applied research using our understanding of the mechanisms governing the evolution of the experimental wheat populations to design more efficient modalities for the on farm dynamic management/in situ conservation of the genetic diversity of cultivated species and to set up participatory breeding programs involving farmers’ networks.
    </p>
    
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      She received her Masters in Genetic Resources and Plant Breeding and her PhD at the Institut National Agronomique – Paris-Grignon

      <p style="text-align: center;">
        Oscar &#8216;Howie&#8217; Smith was born and raised in Maine. Howie received a BS degree from the University of Maine at Orono and graduate degrees from North Carolina State University in Horticultural Science (vegetable breeding). From 1977-1983, he was employed by the USDA on the maize breeding project stationed at Iowa State University. During this time he did theoretical and field research on quantitative genetics as applied to maize improvement.
      </p>
      
      <p style="text-align: center;">
        In 1984 Howie joined Pioneer Hi-Bred International (now owned by DuPont) as a research statistician. He retired from DuPont-Pioneer in 2007 as a Research Fellow in the Product Development Department. When he retired he was responsible for a group that did research on the application of genomic information to product development programs.  This included using genomic information to develop aids to selection, product performance prediction tools, and methodology and tools for germplasm characterization. From 2008-2013 he worked as a consultant to DuPont-Pioneer during which he authored and internal e-book on the history and development of Pioneer elite worldwide germplasm.

          Has been Principal Researcher at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) for several decades and recently joined Catholic Relief Services (CRS) as Senior Technical Advisor focusing on more vulnerable populations. She has managed and technically backstopped seed-related programs in 25+ countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, covering a wide range of crops (cereals, legumes, VPCs) and supporting designs that can reach real scale (for example The Pan Africa Bean Research Alliance delivered new bean varieties to 18.3 million farmers in 10 years).  Sperling’s work encompasses ‘normal’ smallholder farmer systems as well as high stress;  e.g. she led assessment missions during the 1983-85 east African drought, after the 1994 Rwandan genocide, post-earthquake in Haiti and, most recently, linked with the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. Consulting for many agencies (USAID/OFDA, the UN system, the World Bank, Rockefeller, northern and southern NGOs), Sperling has authored over seventy articles,  <i>inter alia</i>: Integrating Seed Systems (with Sara Boettiger and Ian Barker for Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture, 2014) ; Making seed systems more resilient (Global Environmental Change 2013, McGuire and Sperling) and Understanding and strengthening informal seed markets (Experimental Agriculture 2010: Sperling and McGuire) and Moving towards more effective seed aid (Journal of Development Studies 2008, Sperling, Cooper and Remington).  A new website, seedsystem.org shares practical and policy advice for those intervening in smallholder farmer acute and chronic stress contexts.

          <p style="text-align: center;">
            Plant breeders are challenged with sustaining global crop improvements. Is there a limit to crop yield? The Zamir lab is addressing this question using our favorite crop – processing tomatoes. By integrating in a single web-based platform a broad germplasm base, deep ontology defined phenotypes, and multiple genome sequences we identify genes and mechanisms that dictate crop productivity. Our integrated breeding efforts unite classical and genomics assisted methods to demonstrate that yield barriers are only there to be broken.
